    <h1>Objects, and how to handle them</h1>
    <p>
      In preparation for React, it is necessary that we gain a solid understanding two important data types:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Objects</li>
      <li>Arrays</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is important to be familiar with handling these data types (i.e. iterating through arrays, selecting
      elements at specific indexes, accessing the necessary properties of objects, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>Understanding some of the underlying characteristics of objects helps gain a better understanding of objects and
      arrays, so let's spend today's session looking into how Objects are handled in memory.</p>

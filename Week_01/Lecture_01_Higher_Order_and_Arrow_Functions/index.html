  <title>Week 1 Lecture 1: Higher Order and Arrow Functions</title>

    <ul class="vocab">
      <li>Higher Order Function - a function that accepts another function as an argument, and executes it as a callback
        within its own execution</li>
      <li>Callback Function - a function that is defined and provided as its definition, in order to be called back on
        at a later time. They are called <em>by another function</em></li>
      <li>Anonymous Function - a function that is defined, but not declared and saved in memory as a reusable function.
        Basically, a function without a name that is dealt with immediately.</li>
      <li>Arrow Function - a function that defined through a special symbol (a fat arrow; <code>=></code>) that
        functions like a normal function, but is syntactically different. It also differs in its context.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Higher Order Functions (and Arrow Functions)</h1>
    <div class="warmup">
      <h3>Warmup</h3>
      <p>Let's write some for loops! Using the <code>cars</code> array in index.js, write the following loops:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Loop through the array and print the <code>make</code> and <code>model</code> of each car.</li>
        <li>Create a new array. Loop through the cars array and only push cars made after 2012 into the new array.</li>
        <li>Loop through the array and find the first object with a <code>model</code> property of "Sierra"</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h3>What is a Higher Order Function???</h3>
      <p>
        A function can be considered <code>Higher Order</code> if it accepts a function as an argument,
        and runs that function in its execution.

      <h3>Higher Order Array Methods to Learn</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Array.forEach()</li>
        <li>Array.map()</li>
        <li>Array.filter()</li>
        <li>Array.find()</li>
        <li>Array.some()</li>
        <li>Array.every()</li>
        <li>Array.reduce()</li>
      </ul>

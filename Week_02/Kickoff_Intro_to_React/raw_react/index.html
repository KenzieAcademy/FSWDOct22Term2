    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Library</strong> - a set of pre-defined functions, classes, data types, etc., that you can borrow
        and use in your own application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>React</strong> - (also known as React.js) is a JavaScript library that allows us to create
        reusable "components" to build comprehensive client-side web <strong>single page applications</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Single Page Application</strong> - a client-side application that technically only uses a single HTML
        page. The different
        pages that a user interacts with are chunks of DOM elements swapped in and out by JavaScript
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Framework</strong> - similar to a library in that you are using resources created by someone else,
      but where it differs it that your code must follow the flow of the framework.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>JSX</strong> - JSX is a hybrid of JavaScript and HTML that allows you to used
      JavaScript logic mixed between HTML code.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Babel</strong> - a JSX transpiler that converts JSX code into browser-readable JavaScript
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Component</strong> - In React at least, a component is a function (or class, but we'll talk more later on
      that) that returns JSX
    </li>
